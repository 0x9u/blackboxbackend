# What to do left
- Allow typing states in backend
- Have file support
- Have captcha on backend
- Have games support (single player)
- multiplayer games
- Shorten authentication using middleware
- Make a failsafe for same invite code
- ADd some guild shit (edit settings) 
- Add some tests (Im not bothered to do this so I need to be on something probs)
- Modulize the backend (Not too sure yet how I should handle the global variables)
    - make global variables its own module
        - possible bad practice so research more into it
        - modulize each file and split long lengthy functions into files in a folder
